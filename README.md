### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi!  My name is Cheryl (she/her) and I have recently finished a Java full stack bootcamp through Tech Elevator and I am looking to start a new chapter in my career as a software developer.  I have always been a problem solver and an analytical thinker and as a kid I knew that I wanted to get into science and technology - so I did.  

A few years in anaytical chemistry, a partial computer science degree, and  a bootcamp later, here I am ready to code.  Iâ€™m excited to bring my skills to a collaborative team environment that emphasizes quality code craftsmanship.  I am looking for an opportunity to learn and grow while making great software.
